# Daddy's Boring Math Library

Collection of Python PyPI projects of a mathematical nature. It's
purpose is to host and provide infrastructure for the maintainer's
Python mathematical hobby projects.

The overall project's name is **Boring Math** and consists of PyPI
projects with PyPI and GitHub names beginning "boring-math". All
projects are all under the "boring_math" Python namespace.

For more information visit the project's
[homepage](https://grscheller.github.io/boring-math/).

## Boring Math projects

| Name | PyPI | GitHub | Docs | Python Package |
|:---- |:----:|:------:|:----:|:-------------- |
| Integer Math | [boring-math-integer-math][101] | [gh][201] | [gh_pages][301] | boring_math.integer_math |
| Prob Distributions | [boring-math-probability-distributions][102] | [gh][202] | [gh_pages][302] | boring_math.probability_distributions |
| Pythagorean Triples | [boring-math-pythagorean-triples][103] | [gh][203] | [gh_pages][303] | boring_math.pythagorean_triples |
| Recursive Functions | [boring-math-recursive-functions][104] | [gh][204] | [gh_pages][304] | boring_math.recursive_functions |
| Special Functions | [boring-math-special-functions][105] | [gh][205] | [gh_pages][305] | boring_math.special_functions |

These are fun little math projects which I enjoy doing. They have many
loose threads. They are as much to learn Python as they are to to play
with math.
