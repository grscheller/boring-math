# Daddy's Boring Math Library

Collection of Python PyPI projects of a mathematical nature. All under
the `boring-math` namespace. The purpose of this collection is to host and
provide infrastructure for my Python mathematical hobby projects.

The name was suggested by my then 13 year old daughter Mary.

For more information visit the project's
[homepage](https://grscheller.github.io/boring-math/homepage/build/html/).

## Boring Math `boring-math` namespace projects

| Name | PyPI | GitHub | Docs | Python Package |
|:---- |:----:|:------:|:----:|:-------------- |
| Integer Math | [boring-math-integer-math][101] | [gh][201] | [gh_pages][301] | boring_math.integer_math |
| Prob Dists | [boring-math-probability-distributions][102] | [gh][202] | [gh_pages][302] | boring_math.probability_distributions |
| Pythagorean Triples | [boring-math-pythagorean-triples][103] | [gh][203] | [gh_pages][303] | boring_math.pythagorean_triples |
| Recursive Functions | [boring-math-recursive-functions][104] | [gh][204] | [gh_pages][304] | boring_math.recursive_functions |
| Special Functions | [boring-math-special-functions][105] | [gh][205] | [gh_pages][305] | boring_math.special_functions |

These are fun little math projects which I enjoy doing. They have many
loose threads. They are as much to learn Python as they are to to play
with math.
