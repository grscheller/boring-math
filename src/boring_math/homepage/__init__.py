"""
The boring-math PyPI project is the central component of my
*Boring Math* hobby projects. It has several purposes.

- claims the boring-math name on PyPI for the overall effort
- hosts the effort's homepage on *GitHub Pages*
- hosts detailed Sphinx documentation for each *Boring Math* project
- contains the ``boring_math.homepage`` module

  - which is used in the construction of the homepage
  - keeps important information available and modifiable

    - outside of Sphinx boilerplate

- provides locations for effort's overall CHANGELOG and README files

  - the README.md file provides

    - the boring-math PyPI description giving an overview of *Boring Math*
    - provide links to the individual projects on PyPI and their GitHub repos

  - each *Boring Math* project has its on CHANGELOG and README files

There is no need to install boring-math itself, but does not hurt
anything if it is installed.
