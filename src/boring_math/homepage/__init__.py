"""
The boring-math PyPI project is a central component of my
*Boring Math* hobby projects. It has several purposes.

- claims the boring-math name on PyPI for the overall effort
- hosts on *GitHub Pages*

  - the *Boring Math* homepage
  - Sphinx API documentation for each *Boring Math* project

- PyPI project itself for the ``boring_math.homepage`` module
- provides locations for overarching CHANGELOG and README files

  - each *Boring Math* project has its on CHANGELOG and README files

There is no need to install boring-math itself, but does not hurt
anything if it is installed.
