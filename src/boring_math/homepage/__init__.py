.. admonition:: Purpose of the boring-math PyPI Project

    The `boring-math PyPI project <https://pypi.org/project/boring-math/>`_ 
    is a central component of my Boring Math hobby projects.

    - It is the PyPI project for the ``boring_math.homepage`` module.
    - Claims the boring-math name on PyPI for the overall effort.
    - Hosts on *GitHub Pages*

    - The Boring Math homepage.
    - Sphinx API & documentation for each Boring Math project.

    - Provides locations for overarching CHANGELOG and README files.

    - Each Boring Math project has its own CHANGELOG and README files.

.. tip::

    There is no reason to install boring-math itself, but does not hurt
    anything if it is installed.
