"""
Daddy's Boring Math Library
===========================

The overall effort's name is
`Boring Math <https://pypi.org/project/boring-math/>`_.
It consists of Python projects whose names on PyPI and GitHub
all begin with *"boring-math-"*. Each project implements a top-level
package in the ``boring_math`` Python namespace.

The name "Daddy's Boring Math Library" was suggested by my then
13 year old daughter Mary.
