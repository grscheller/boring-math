Remarks
-------

.. attention::
    Maintainer will try to keep these top level releases consistent
    with each other as much as possible, but makes no guarantees.

.. important::

    When a package needs updated dependencies, the package
    will be upgraded first before any of its dependencies.
    This will prevent pip from installing the package until
    all its dependencies are in place.

.. important::

    When a package needs updating in a way that is not
    consistent with packages that depend on it, the packages
    dependent on it will be upgraded first.

.. note::

    In the development environment, packages and their
    dependencies are usually developed in parallel along
    with their test suites.


**Footnotes**

.. [#]

    Maintainer soon plans to break up boring-math-integer-math
    into two PyPI projects, ``boring-math-number-theory`` and 
    ``boring-math-combinatorics``.
